# Bitcoin_Core_RPC_par_address
Search through Bitcoin Coreâ€™s RPC to find any information on any address.

You'll need to add the lines found on bitcoin.conf to your bitcoin core
system and reindex it if you haven't done so yet.

To open the bitcoin.conf file run bitcoin core, go to Settings>Options
and click the "Open Configuration File" button. Press OK button. Copy
and paste the lines on the bitcoin.conf file I have written to your file,
press the Save button and close the window.

To reindex, when you start bitcoin core add the command -reindex.
Example:
If your bitcoin core was installed in the /usr/local/bin folder, you would
start it like this: /usr/local/bin/bitcoin-qt -reindex

This will take a very long time to complete. Currently it is taking me about
5 days to complete.

Once you are comfortable playing with the program, change the rpcuser name
and rpcpassword for security reasons. But for now you can leave it like it
is in the files to get started playing with the program
