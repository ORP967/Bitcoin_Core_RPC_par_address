# Bitcoin_Core_RPC_par_address
Search through Bitcoin Coreâ€™s RPC to find any information on any address.

You'll need to add the lines found on bitcoin.conf to your bitcoin core
system and reindex it if you haven't done so yet.

Once you are comfortable playing with the program, change the rpcuser name
and rpcpassword for security reasons. But for now you can leave it like it
is in the files to get started playing with the program.
