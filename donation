BitCoin is about giving the whole world all the transactions ever created since the Genesis block. It is a disgrace, in my point of view, that they are
limiting us to only be able to search for information from our own wallet. If we want to search for any address, we have to go to a website like BLock
Chain Explorer (I'm wondering if they have some sort of deal going on). But why do I need to log on to a site when I have all transactions in my system?
So I came up with this program.

I've spent endless weekends and months going through endless files. I crashed my system many times (at least twice including bitcoin core and had to download
the whole thing). But if you like the fact that now you can search for any addresses on bitcoin core using this program and want to make any donation this is
the address:

My next project will be to be able to CPU mine. Yes, Bitcoin Core does not allow us to CPU mine, another deal going on somewhere?
